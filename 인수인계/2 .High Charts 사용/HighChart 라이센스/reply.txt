Hi,
Sorry for the late reply.
 
Unfortunately, after a purchase is complete, there is no way we can change the information in the billing address.
Note that the License Statement is your proof of license. Let us know if anything must be changed, and we will help you as soon as we can.
 
Sorry for the inconvenience.
 
Best regards,
Guro Myrkaskog
